    <td>I learnt how to make a 'Pyg Latin' translator (from english to pyg latin). I found it effective to work really slowly and carefully so that I didn’t make any mistakes, as anything that was slightly wrong could ruin the whole code and make the whole hour’s worth of work completely redundant.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It limited my learning when I had to help other, slower people with their work, as it meant that I had less time to focus on what I needed to be concentrating on and meant that I couldn’t get as much done as I feel I could’ve.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to be even more methodical and make sure to focus on my own work rather than helping someone who hasn’t listened or simply doesn’t understand it because they haven’t been concentrating in earlier excercises.</td>
