    <td>I learnt a little bit about how to perform equations by using symbols such as an asterix (*) or using inequalities (< and >) to make console outputs. I learnt that the best way to work through the tasks was to go slowly and methodically, taking my time with each stage and trying to make sure to be as accurate as possible.</td>

    <td>I need to work on not going too fast and getting ahead of myself so that I can minimize the chances of making a mistake, which could potentially set me back quite a lot and mean that I would just have to go back and then be slow and methodical whilst going through the checking  process, which - if there is a lot of code - can be quite monotonous.</td>
